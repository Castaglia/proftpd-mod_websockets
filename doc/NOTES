Questions

How to require user authentication?  Which HTTP authentication schemes to
support?

Thoughts

Structure mod_websockets to be like mod_sftp, where it "hijacks" the command
loop, once a TCP connection is established.

Haven't seen any drafts yet for any file transfer protocols over WebSockets.
Might want to start collecting thoughts on this, based one experiences with
FTP, SFTP, SCP, rsync, etc.

Performance

  How to best measure performance of data transfers via this module, compared
  to SFTP/SCP (mod_sftp), FTPS (mod_tls), or just plain FTP (and HTTP)?

    JMeter for HTTP, but it doesn't support the other session-oriented
    protocols.  Might have to work up something else in the meantime.

    important consideration.  Gives a great example of cache poisoning
